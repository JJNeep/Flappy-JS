# Flappy-JS
this is a small project I have been working on that I like to call Flappy JS. Flappy JS is flappy bird in javascript. I have created both an html page that you can see [here](https://jjneep.github.io/Flappy-JS/) and a bookmarklet.
## How to use the bookmarklet
#### 1. go to [flappy_bird - compressed](flappy_bird%20-%20compressed.js) and copy the code.
#### 2. create a new bookmark and paste in the code
## What can I do with this
I have created this for everyone to remix, edit and use. Please however give credit. you can see the license [here](LICENSE)
