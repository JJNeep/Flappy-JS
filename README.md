# Flappy-JS
this is a small project I have been working on that I like to call Flappy JS. Flappy JS is flappy bird in javascript. I have created both an html page that you can see [here](https://jjneep.github.io/Flappy-JS/) and a bookmarklet.
# How to use the bookmarklet
## 1
go to [flappy_bird - compressed]() and copy the code.
## 2
create a new bookmark and paste the code in there
